# Tictapper version V4

This program used to insert URLS to NFS Stickers and relate their ids to the urls in a db.

The main program is the main.js (obviously) but the real work is done on the apiTictapper.js.

The xxxx2.js programs are WIP with the objective to replace the main file.

And if ther's a file with the name xxxxlegacy.js it means the file is done by Joel and the legacy is the Jordi's code and it can be deleted theoretically
